# Description
Once there was a programmer who was living in The Pit. While he was teaching an advanced data structure, he suddenly turned into Meme-Man, the greatest superhero of Kundura City. Meme-Man’s arch-nemesis Treap-Man created a giant staircase to attack the city. The only way to stop the giant staircase is to reach its top by climbing 
x or y stairs at a time. Meme-Man wonders how many different ways there are to do this. Help our hero by satisfying his curiosity.

Hint: Stair N is accessible only from stair N − x and stair N−y. That is, the number of ways to climb N is the sum of the number of ways to climb N−x and N−y.

## Input Format
In the first line there is N, the number of stairs.
